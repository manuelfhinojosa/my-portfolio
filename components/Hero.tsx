          I’m a full-stack software engineer with a background in mechatronics
          engineering and over two years of experience building and maintaining
          real-world applications across web, desktop, and industrial
          environments. I work primarily with JavaScript, React, Node.js, and
          SQL databases, and I enjoy designing clean, scalable solutions that
          balance functionality, performance, and maintainability. My experience
          includes developing full-stack applications end-to-end, building REST
          APIs, and working with relational databases like PostgreSQL and SQL
          Server. Before focusing fully on software, I worked as a mechatronics
          engineer and robotics instructor, which gave me a strong foundationgit
          in systems thinking, debugging complex problems, and collaborating
          across technical disciplines. That engineering mindset still shapes
          how I approach software development today. I’m comfortable working in
          remote and cross-functional teams, and I care deeply about writing
          clear, reliable code and continuously improving as an engineer. I’m
          currently seeking opportunities where I can grow as a software
          engineer and contribute to building meaningful, well-designed
          products.
